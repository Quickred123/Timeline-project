            The Early Republic (509BC - 107BC)
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            The Roman Republic was founded after the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom in 509 BC
            after the fall of the last king of Rome, a republic was installed in its stead.
            The republic was a cultural blend of Greek, Latin, and Etruscan worlds.
            Despite the name, the Roman Republic was actually an oligarchy.
            Power was divided amongst a select few of individuals from the aristocracy.

            The Late Republic (107BC - 27BC)

        <p id="Late Republic p1" class="paragraphs">
            By 107BC, Rome had conquered the Italian peninsula, wipped Carthage from the map,
            established hegemony over the Hellenistic world, and crippled the once formidable Selucid Empire in the east.

            As the Republic expanded around the Mediterranean, more power was given to the military.
            Corruption ran rampant in Roman society from soldiers to high ranking officials
            and this weakness was demonstrated in the Jugurthine War in Numidia.
            A prominent military leader named Gaius Marius took notice of this and used his power as Consul to reform it.
            Despite the laws against it, Marius was elected consul 7 times in his carrer.
            Although Marius' reforms were progressive, they made soldiers more loyal to their generals rather than Rome itself.
            This paved the way for more ambitious generals to take power for themselves.

        <p id="Late Republic p2" class="paragraphs">
            From 91 to 88 BC, many of the Italic states revolted against Rome. This uprising became known as the Social War.
            Although the Romans were able to quell the rebellion, it came at a catostrophic cost.
            As a result of the devistation caused from the infighting,
            Rome was forced to extend citizenship to the surrounding states.
